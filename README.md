# IoT-SYSTEM-DESIGN---Smart-Plant-Health-Monitoring
A complete end-to-end IoT solution using Raspberry Pi, Python, and Microsoft Azure to monitor plant health and growth in different environments through environmental sensors (temperature, humidity, moisture, light, and growth).

# Features
• Multiple sensors (DHT22, ultrasonic, soil moisture, VEML7700) into a custom hardware circuit, capturing real-time data from both indoor and outdoor plant environments.
• Flask-based web dashboard to visualize sensor data, health scores, and personalized recommendations based on plant conditions.
• Configured Azure IoT Hub, Stream Analytics, Blob Storage, and Power BI to securely transmit, process, and visualize sensor data; implemented SQL queries for real-time data analytics and alerts.
• Hybrid storage solution using SQLite for local data persistence and Azure Blob Storage for cloud scalability while minimizing resource costs.
• Secure data handling with SAS tokens, encrypted transmission, and container access control within Azure.
